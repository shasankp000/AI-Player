                " 2. Look around for any hostile mobs, and report to me if you find any.\n" +

                " 4. Craft a set of iron armor.\n" +
                " 5. Did you go somewhere recently?\n" +
                "\n" +
                " These are the following intentions which the prompt may cater to and which you have to figure out:\n" +
                "\n" +
                " 1. REQUEST_ACTION: This intention corresponds towards requesting a minecraft bot to take an action such as going somewhere, exploring, scouting etc.\n" +
                " 2. ASK_INFORMATION: This intention corresponds asking a minecraft bot for information, which could be about the game or anything else.\n" +
                " 3. GENERAL_CONVERSATION: This intention corresponds towards just making general conversation or small talk with the minecraft bot.\n" +
                " 4. UNSPECIFIED: This intention corresponds to a message which lacks enough context for proper understanding.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " How to classify intentions:\n" +
                "\n" +
                " First of all, you need to know about the types of sentences in english grammar.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " Types of Sentences:\n" +
                " Sentences can be classified into types based on two aspects – their function and their structure. They are categorised into four types based on their function and into three based on their structure. Assertive/declarative, interrogative, imperative and exclamatory sentences are the four types of sentences. The three types of sentences, according to the latter classification, are simple, complex and compound sentences.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " Let us look at each of these in detail.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " An assertive/declarative sentence is one that states a general fact, a habitual action, or a universal truth.  For example, ‘Today is Wednesday.’\n" +
                " An imperative sentence is used to give a command or make a request. Unlike the other three types of sentences, imperative sentences do not always require a subject; they can start with a verb. For example, ‘Turn off the lights and fans when you leave the class.’\n" +
                " An interrogative sentence asks a question. For example, ‘Where do you stay?’\n" +
                " An exclamatory sentence expresses sudden emotions or feelings. For example, ‘What a wonderful sight!’\n" +
                "\n" +
                " Now, let us learn what simple, compound and complex sentences are. This categorisation is made based on the nature of clauses in the sentence.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " Simple sentences contain just one independent clause. For instance, ‘The dog chased the little wounded bird.’\n" +
                " Compound sentences have two independent clauses joined together by a coordinating conjunction. For instance, ‘I like watching Marvel movies, but my friend likes watching DC movies.’\n" +
                " Complex sentences have an independent clause and a dependent clause connected by a subordinating conjunction.  For example, ‘Though we were tired, we played another game of football.’\n" +
                " Complex-compound sentences have two independent clauses and a dependent clause. For instance, ‘Although we knew it would rain, we did not carry an umbrella, so we got wet.’\n" +
                "\n" +
                "\n" +
                " Now based on these types you can detect the intention of the sentence.\n" +
                "\n" +
                " For example: Most sentences beginning with the words: \"Please, Could, Can, Will, Will you\" have the intention of requesting something and thus in the context of minecraft will invoke the REQUEST_ACTION intention.\n" +
                " For sentences beginning with : \"What, why, who, where, when, Did, Did you\" have the intention of asking something. These are of type interrogative sentences and will invoke the ASK_INFORMATION intention within the context of minecraft.\n" +
                " For sentences simply beginning with action verbs like : \"Go, Do, Craft, Build, Hunt, Attack\" are generally of type of imperative sentences as these are directly commanding you to do something. Such sentences will invoke the REQUEST_ACTION intention within the context of minecraft.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "And for normal sentences like : \"I ate a sandwich today\" or \"The weather is nice today\", these are declarative/assertive sentences, and within the context of minecraft, will invoke the intention of GENERAL_CONVERSATION.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Anything outside of this lacks context and will invoke the intention of UNSPECIFIED within the context of minecraft.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "A few more examples for your better learning.\n" +
                "\n" +
